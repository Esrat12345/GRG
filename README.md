Project Title: Geo Track AI: Smart GNSS Movement Analysis & Map-Matching

Description: Geo Track AI is an innovative AI-driven project designed to enhance vehicular tracking accuracy by utilizing coarse GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) data. The project aims to implement a map-matching algorithm that distinguishes between highway and service road movements, providing users with real-time route suggestions and traffic alerts to reduce emissions and congestion.
Objectives:

Develop an AI-ML-based map-matching algorithm for precise vehicular movement tracking.
Differentiate between highway and service road navigation with high accuracy.
Deliver real-time routing suggestions and traffic updates to alleviate congestion.
Key Features:

Map-Matching Algorithm: A machine learning model that enhances location tracking accuracy by matching GNSS data to map data.
Real-Time Alerts: Instant traffic and routing alerts.
Visualization Dashboard: An interactive web dashboard for monitoring movement patterns on maps.
Tech Stack:

Machine Learning: TensorFlow or PyTorch for model development.
Visualization: Folium for creating interactive maps.
Deployment: Docker for containerization, Vultr services for hosting and scalability.
Project Timeline:

Week 1: Data acquisition and preprocessing.
Week 2: Development of the map-matching algorithm.
Week 3: Model training and evaluation.
Week 4: Deployment and system testing.
Deliverables:

A functional map-matching model with integrated machine learning.
A real-time routing and alert system.
A web-based visualization dashboard for user interaction.
How to Use:

Setup: Follow instructions to install dependencies and initialize the environment.
Usage: Access real-time tracking features and monitor movements on the interactive dashboard.
